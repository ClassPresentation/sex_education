        <h1>Abstinence Only Education</h1>
        <h3 id="pro">Pros:</h3>
          <ul id="pro">
            <li>"Abstinence from sex is the only form of pregnancy prevention that is
              100% effective. Every method of contraception has a risk of failure,
              however, small, but a teen who practices abstinence will never become
              pregnant" (Lowen).</li>
            <li>"A teen who practices abstinence and is in a romantic relationship
              is secure in the knowledge that her/his partner is not interested in
              them purely for sex -- a concern of many teens" (Lowen).</li>
            <li>"Abstinence costs nothing and there are no side effects as there are with
              oral contraceptives and many other forms of pregnancy prevention" (Lowen).</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 id="con">Cons:</h3>
          <ul id="con">
            <li>Doesn't teach about mental sexual health and similar issues that occur
            in romantic relationships</li>
            <li>“Abstinence-only education doesn't affect the rates at which teenagers
              decide to have sex” (Boskey).</li>
            <li>Does not mention LGBTQ+ sex much less how to safely have homosexual sex</li>
            <li>Does not debunk common misconceptions about pregnancy and sex</li>
            <li>Does not teach about the dangers of STI’s</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="sex">
        <h1>Comprehensive Sex Education</h1>
        <h3 id="pro">Pros:</h3>
          <ul id="pro">
            <li>“Admittedly, comprehensive sex education doesn't discourage kids
              from having sex either. However, it does teach them how to do so more
              safely.” (Boskey)</li>
            <li>“Just Because You Have a Raincoat Doesn't Mean It's Going To Rain”
              (Boskey) This means that just because a person has the knowledge to
              have safe sex does not mean they are going to.</li>
            <li>Many comprehensive sex curriculums also speak on abstinence and do
              not shy away from the topic, unlike abstinence curriculums that only
              talk about birth control as negative and ineffective.</li>
            <li>“A 2007 study published in the American Journal of Public Health
              found that teens who start using condoms from the first time they have
              intercourse score higher on several sexual health measures than teens
              who don't …. they were 30 percent more likely to have used condoms during
              their most recent sexual experience. They were also only half as likely to
              have been infected with chlamydia and gonorrhea” (Stanger-Hall, Kathrin F,
              and David W Hall).</li>
            <li>“The share of adolescents aged 15–19 who had received formal instruction
              about how to say no to sex but had received no instruction about birth control
              methods increased between 2006–2010 and 2011–2013, from 22% to 28% among females
              and from 29% to 35% among males” (Guttmatcher Institute).</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 id="con">Cons:</h3>
          <ul id="con">
            <li>The contraceptive methods taught in comprehensive sex education are
              not 100% effective because only abstinence is 100% effective</li>
            <li>By shining light on the topic of sex it may encourage early sexual
              activity</li>
            <li>Teachers may not be experts on sexual education and can teach
               incorrect information</li>
            <li>Not LGBTQ+ inclusive</li>
