    <h1>Abstinence Only</h1>
    <h3>Pros:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Abstinence from sex is the only form of pregnancy prevention that is
          100% effective. Every method of contraception has a risk of failure,
          however, small, but a teen who practices abstinence will never become
          pregnant" (Lowen).</li>
        <li>"A teen who practices abstinence and is in a romantic relationship
          is secure in the knowledge that her/his partner is not interested in
          them purely for sex -- a concern of many teens" (Lowen).</li>
        <li>"Abstinence costs nothing and there are no side effects as there are with
          oral contraceptives and many other forms of pregnancy prevention" (Lowen).</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Cons:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Doesn't teach about mental sexual health and similar issues that occur
        in romantic relationships</li>
        <li>“Abstinence-only education doesn't affect the rates at which teenagers
          decide to have sex” (Boskey).</li>
      </ul>
