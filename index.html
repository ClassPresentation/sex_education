      <h1>Abstinence Only</h1>
      <h3 id="pro">Pros:</h3>
        <ul id="pro">
          <li>"Abstinence from sex is the only form of pregnancy prevention that is
            100% effective. Every method of contraception has a risk of failure,
            however, small, but a teen who practices abstinence will never become
            pregnant" (Lowen).</li>
          <li>"A teen who practices abstinence and is in a romantic relationship
            is secure in the knowledge that her/his partner is not interested in
            them purely for sex -- a concern of many teens" (Lowen).</li>
          <li>"Abstinence costs nothing and there are no side effects as there are with
            oral contraceptives and many other forms of pregnancy prevention" (Lowen).</li>
        </ul>
      <h3 id="con">Cons:</h3>
        <ul id="con">
          <li>Doesn't teach about mental sexual health and similar issues that occur
          in romantic relationships</li>
          <li>“Abstinence-only education doesn't affect the rates at which teenagers
            decide to have sex” (Boskey).</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Safe Sex Education</h1>
      <h3 id="pro">Pros:</h3>
        <ul id="pro">
          <li>“Admittedly, comprehensive sex education doesn't discourage kids
            from having sex either. However, it does teach them how to do so more
            safely.” (Boskey)</li>
          <li>“Just Because You Have a Raincoat Doesn't Mean It's Going To Rain”
            (Boskey) This means that just because a person has the knowledge to
            have safe sex does not mean they are going to.</li>
          <li>Many comprehensive sex curriculums also speak on abstinence and do
            not shy away from the topic, unlike abstinence curriculums that only
            talk about birth control as negative and ineffective.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3 id="con">Cons:</h3>
        <ul id="con">
          <li>The contraceptive methods taught in comprehensive sex education are
            not 100% effective because only abstinence is 100% effective</li>
          <li>By shining light on the topic of sex it may encourage early sexual
            activity</li>
          <li>Teachers may not be experts on sexual education and can teach
             incorrect information</li>
          <li>Not LGBTQ+ inclusive</li>
        </ul>
